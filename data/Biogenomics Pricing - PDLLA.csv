"I think for the potential super high volume users (Diamond & Ruby Tier) instead of lowering price or giving additional reward points, we can give exclusive & invite only events/dinners/experiences to bring added value, loyalty, and prestige to reward them for their high usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I also think that the hypothetical Ruby Tier should either not exist or not be published. Maintaining company margins, value, and pricing integrity is important. I also think that giving the extra 2 or 3 reward points per dollar is too aggressive and further cuts our pricing integrity/value too low. My preference is 1 Point Per $1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
